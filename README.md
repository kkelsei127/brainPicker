## Description

This weeks challenge was to create a coding quiz from scratch! It has a functional time keeping element that decrements for each wrong answer selected. The quiz consists of five questions and three answer choices. Additionally, it logs the users score and name and outputs it to a leaderboard! Try your luck and see how many you can get right!
